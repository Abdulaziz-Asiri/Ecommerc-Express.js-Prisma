# E-commerce back-end project with Express.js


This e-commerce back-end project built using <strong>Express.js</strong>, the project leverages the efficiency and flexibility of <strong>Prisma ORM</strong> for database management with <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> and employs <strong>Kafka</strong> as a messaging broker for real-time data streaming and microservices communication.

## Key Features
<ul>
<li>User Management: Secure registration, authentication, and user profile management.</li>
<li>Product Management: CRUD operations for product listings, detailed categorization, and inventory control.</li>
<li>Order Management: Smooth order handling, including order creation, updates, and status tracking, along with full support for transactions and rollback in case of errors.</li>
<li>Shopping Cart: Cart operations that support item addition, removal, and cart retrieval for user convenience.</li>
<li>Payment Integration: Placeholder for secure payment processing integration.
Full-Text Search: Efficient product search functionality with support for advanced filtering and sorting.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Express.js</b>: Provides the framework for developing a scalable REST API.</li>
<li><b>Prisma ORM</b>: Prisma ORM Simplifies database interactions with PostgreSQL, allowing schema definition through TypeScript for clear and maintainable code.</li>
<li><b>PostgreSQL</b>: Used as the primary relational database, optimized for data integrity, complex queries, and transaction handling.</li>
<li><b>Kafka</b>: Facilitates real-time communication for high-demand features like order tracking, notifications, and microservices support.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>


### Kafka Usage
Kafka enables asynchronous, real-time communication across services. Events such as "Order Created," "Order Status," or "User logging " are published to Kafka topics, ensuring immediate updates across all services without impacting performance. This design allows seamless scaling of features such as notifications, analytics, and integration with other microservices.

## Testing the API with Postman
To test the API endpoints with Postman, follow these steps:
  1. Install Postman
If you haven't already, download and install Postman.

2. You can import an API collection in Postman to have all endpoints pre-configured:

-  Import Postman collection in the repository "E-commerce.postman_collection", go to File > Import in Postman and upload the JSON file.
- The collection will appear in the left panel, where you can see all available endpoints.
